## Project Overview

Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a vast amount of data, which can be analyzed and used for various purposes, including enhancing security measures, making informed business decisions, understanding customer and host behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, and implementing innovative additional services.

This dataset, focusing on Airbnb listings in New York City for the year 2019, contains around 49,000 observations with 16 columns. The data is a mix of categorical and numeric values, providing a rich source of information for exploration and analysis.

## Key Objectives

Explore and analyze the data to uncover key insights, including but not limited to:

1. **What can we learn about different hosts and areas?**
   - Identify notable hosts and understand their influence in different neighborhoods.

2. **What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)**
   - Explore the relationship between neighborhood areas, prices, and the number of reviews.
   - Identify patterns and correlations that contribute to predictions.

3. **Which hosts are the busiest and why?**
   - Identify the busiest hosts based on factors such as the number of reviews and room types.
   - Understand the characteristics that contribute to host busyness.

4. **Is there any noticeable difference in traffic among different areas, and what could be the reason for it?**
   - Analyze traffic patterns in terms of the minimum number of nights stayed for different room types and neighborhoods.
   - Understand guest preferences and potential reasons for variations in traffic.

## Notebooks and Tools

### Notebooks

1. [Google Drive Import](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zRZv0eqaY94D4CEpTICRqKSlMH2wxm2E): Mounting Google Drive to access the dataset and importing it for initial exploration.

### Data Analysis Tools

- **Python:**
  - Utilizing libraries such as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

- **Tableau:**
  - Explore interactive visualizations on the [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirbnbTableau_16884627478810/Dashboard4?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

- **Microsoft Excel:**
  - Additional insights and visualizations available in the [Excel Analysis](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AiRYdqGxH35EgWc-2QktrV3r_slq?e=d25bbq).

## Conclusions

1. **Hosts and Areas:**
   - Notable hosts such as Sonder (NYC), Blueground, Michael, David play a significant role in offering diverse accommodation options in different neighborhoods.

2. **Predictions:**
   - Popular areas with a higher number of reviews may indicate tourist hotspots.
   - Lower-priced listings attract more reviews, suggesting a preference for budget-friendly options.

3. **Busiest Hosts:**
   - Hosts such as Dona, Ji, Maya, Carol, Danielle are the busiest due to their offerings of Entire home/apartment or Private room types.

4. **Traffic Patterns:**
   - Preferences for Entire home/apartment or Private room types in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.
   - Guests tend to stay longer in such listings, indicating potential preferences for more extensive stays.
